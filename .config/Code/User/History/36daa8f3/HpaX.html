    <h2>MySpace</h2>
    <p>
      Launched on August 1, 2003, the site was the first social network to reach a global audience, and had a significant influence on technology, pop culture and music.
      From 2005 to 2009, Myspace was the largest social networking site in the world
     Playing a critical role in the early growth of companies, like YouTube, and creating a developer platform that launched the successes of Zynga, PhotoBucket, and Rock You, MySpace will be a lasting memory of the early Internet days. 
     Once the biggest social media site and acquired for $580 million, MySpace fell off the top because of poor management and good competitors.

    <h2>Bebo</h2>
    <p>
     Bebo was an American social networking website that originally operated from 2005 until its bankruptcy in 2013, and relaunched in February 2021. It was founded by Michael Birch and Xochi Birch, a married couple who loved to blog; 
      “B log E arly, B log, O ften.” 
      The site relaunched several times after its bankruptcy with a number of short-lived offerings, including instant messaging and video streaming, until its acquisition by Amazon in July 2019 when it was shut down. It was announced in January 2021 that it would be returning as a new social media site the month after. By May 2022, it had been once again shut down, without ever having left beta testing. If you visit the site now, it only displays a heartfelt message from the creator. 
      
      
      “We tried our best to resurrect Bebo.  
      To create something new and fresh.  
      But perhaps it wasn't new or fresh enough.
      This has been a fun project built during the pandemic, but sadly it must be sunsetted. We are grateful to everyone who joined us on this journey. Your support is greatly appreciated.
      Will Bebo rise again? 
      Who knows. It has now lived four times, been sold twice. Hmm.
      It's been emotional.”

         When I was in Middle Shool, the biggest site to have a profile on for sure.
